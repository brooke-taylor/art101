			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to further refine and establish a local fire structure on my laptop. Additionally, adding and refining index.html files while documenting the process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Finding a good image of myself for the website, haha. In all seriousness, it was a little difficult properly implementing the images into the structure, but I think I managed ok! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I would say this assignment went quite well. I'm very glad to have learned adding images to this structure is literally as simple as dragging and dropping into the desired folder - and I also think I understand the structure of CSS a bit better too!</p>
