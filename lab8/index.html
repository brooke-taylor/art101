			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks in Javascript. Similar to lab 7, we created a unique index.html document from scratch, as well as a unique javascript file for the lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a couple small issues with Task X, and figuring out how exactly to implement the map function results. It might've been be misreading the assignment guidelines on my end - but I was able to link the element properly in the end! Other than that, everything mostly went smooth aside from some minor typos. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I came into this assignment a little apprehensive following last Lab, which was comparatively much more difficult than any other lab leading up to this point. Functions are still a bit challenging for me to grasp, but I thankfully feel much more comfortable writing and calling them after this lab! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results - Script Output</h2>
				<p>For this lab the results are viewable below, but also in the console! You can go ahead and open it with: </p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Command + Option + J </b>on Mac.</li>
				<li><b>Control + Shift + J </b>on Windows.</li>
				</ul>
				<div id = "output"></div> <!--For jQuery-->
