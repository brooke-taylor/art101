			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work through two pseudocoding tasks with a partner, and implement the second task's code into a text editor as javascript comments. The first task was to pseudocode an everyday task, while the second was to do the same with a simple game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not too many problems cropped up this time around, thankfully! It was a pretty smooth experience considering it was entirely based on planning code, rather than programming anything directly. If anything, it was a little difficult to come up with subtasks for our chosen tasks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I appreciated how smoothly this assignment went, and better understand the logic behind using pseudocode. Additionally, I now have a very rudimentary foundation on javascript, and I'm excited to learn more! </p>
