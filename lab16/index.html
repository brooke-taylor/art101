			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to further experiment with API, now processing JSON from a given API. In this example, we were to use the XKCD json.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Well, as you can [probably?] see, the comic doesn't actually output.. though since the error message is displaying correctly, I'd like to assume this is because of something on the API's end rather than mine. (I hope.) I've spent a good while tinkering with it and can't seem to find a sollution, but stay tuned!  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a pretty daunting assignment, in all honesty. It sucks that this is the first lab I genuinely couldn't get to work, but I'm happy I at least got functional error code, if anything; it means something at least worked! I put forward an honest effort and while it wasn't a complete success, I'm still alright with the outcome. </p>
