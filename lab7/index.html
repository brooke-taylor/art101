			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with writing functions that took user input and manipulated them into different strings. We additionally were tasked with making a new index.html for this lab rather than it being provided, and overall being sure our code was functional.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>So, so incredibly many... this lab was the first that genuinely challenged me, and it took a few hours of work to sort everything out. I'll be honest, the concept of functions was quite difficult for me to grasp, and the bonus task took quite a bit of thought and research to execute properly. Fixing all my problems in this lab was a matter of trial and error, constantly refreshing the local page in my browser through many iterations, and overall a lot of editing til I got things to work.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Honestly, this lab got quite frustrating at times, but I'm glad I was able to pull through! I still have a long ways to go with really learning about how functions work - how to make them execute when I want them to, their scopes, etc, but I definitely feel a bit more comfortable with them than I did prior to this lab.</p>
