			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this Lab was to declare arrays and objects within a browser console, and then in our text editor. We were then asked to write out a script in Java that outputs these lists into our lab's index.html !</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some small issues with the script output - I accidentally used square instead of curly brackets for the object, and mistyped a couple things in the output statement. But all ended up working fine, thankfully! I feel much more comfortable with differentiating objects and arrays coming away from the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went quite smoothly thanks to the demonstrations in lecture, I could callback to the examples we'd worked through when I ran into my own problems. Overall, I feel better in utilizing both objects and arrays following this lab. </p>
