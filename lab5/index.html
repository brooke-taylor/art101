			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with declaring and referencing variables within Javascript; first in a browser console and then rewritten in our editor. Afterwards, we output our script into our index.html ! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A couple minor issues arose when working with the console, though these were simple fixes on my end: forgetting semicolons, making small errors with capitalization, but I was able to resolve them all relatively quickly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was easygoing without being TOO easygoing, which was nice! I feel like I've learned more about the functions of Javascript and utilizing variables, and I continue to get more familiar with updating my homepage using html. </p>
