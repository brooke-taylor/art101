					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, we need to construct a webpage from an empty html file. We need to include the text "Hello World", with a paragraph about ourself and our partner. After this structure is estbalished, we are to use CSS to make the site more visually appealing!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At least for me, I found it quite difficult successfully linking the style sheet to my HTML document. I had to mess around a lot and look at example code in canvas to properly get things working - it was certainly a great feeling when I did!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, I enjoyed this assignment after the intial hiccups! I came into it willing to learn, and I do feel like I have a better grasp on HTML and CSS as a result. </p>
