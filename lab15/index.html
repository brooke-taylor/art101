			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment further with jQuery and AJAX - taking content from an outside API and requesting it onto our own webpages here!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Honestly, I didn't run into many problems at all, following the template. Which, I'm thankful for, the past couple Labs seemed to have issues cropping up one after the other, so I'm glad to have had a relaxing lab!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was one of my more enjoyable assignments for sure, something about APIs just.. "clicked" more in my brain I think? I came into this with a hopefult attitude, and utilized class and outside resources in order to get functional code going. The additional CSS styling was fun, too. :]</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
