			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to write functions that depend on conditionals, with a theme based on a certain wizarding world.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In all honesty, not many at all! There were just a couple minor formatting issues but it was majorly very smooth sailing, thankfully. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went really well - thanks to referencing and looking for resources when I found myself getting stuck on some of Task X's challenges. I feel more comfortable linking between JS and HTML files, as well as formatting code in general. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Results</h2>
